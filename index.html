<!-- In this first section I have included a header that will contain the 
  main title that will be incorporated into an anchor element 
  and a navigation list for the three main pages.
  This part with the title and the nav element will be copied also in the three main pages 
  and in a fourth page which will be a simple page with a confirmation message after completing a form.

  Then, only for the first page, I will add main-image (hero-image)  along with a cover text 
  (containing a suggestive Bible verse) that will have a keyframe applied 
  to slide from the left side onto the hero image. 
  For the keyframe I was inspired from this web site: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/keyframe-animations/-->

  <!-- In the description section I wrote the main reasons for creating the site, 
    namely the need of believers to know their own faith, 
    then I offered preliminary information about the possibility of registering for catechetical meetings 
    organized in the city of Leipzig by the parish priest together with some theologians.

    Then I added an image with an Orthodox icon with the Last Supper, 
    to show people that the Apostles were also catechized by Jesus, 
    then I added a second image that shows a group of people participating in a spiritual meeting with a priest, 
    to show people that such meetings are wanted and useful.

    Next, I have inserted a list with the important information about catechesis, briefly dotted, 
    in this list I have included three links, the first leads to the website of the parish where catechesis takes place, 
    the second leads to the page with the structure of catechesis and the last link to access form page. -->

      <h2>The need to know and practice one's own belief </h2>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Faith is a gift from God</em></strong>, this gift must be worked on and increased to help us get to
        know God better and experience
        Him in a real way through his grace.</p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Indifference and ignorance are considered sins</em></strong>, because they separate people from God,
        and thus people forget
        their purpose on this earth and lose the possibility of spiritual growth necessary to acquire love for God and
        all humans, qualities necessary for the eternal salvation of the soul created after in the Image and
        Likeness of God.
      </p>
      <p>The path of faith is a chance to grow in a <strong><em>personal relationship with God. </em></strong>
        A relationship that God showed us that he wants by sending his Son to earth to teach us everything
        about faith and who sacrificed Himself by giving His life for us on the cross.
      </p>
      <p>Seeing that many believers, even though they are baptized, no longer know their own faith, but have the
        desire to find more about it, we decided to help them by <strong><em>organizing orthodox catechesis in our
            Orthodox Church from the german town Leipzig</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>The catechesis will be organized and presented by the parish priest together with some Orthodox theology
        graduates from our parish.</p>
      <p>If you are interested,
        please <strong><em>fill out the form that you finde it on the registration page</em></strong> and send it to us,
        then we will send you a
        confirmation email with all the information you need to attend our meetings.
