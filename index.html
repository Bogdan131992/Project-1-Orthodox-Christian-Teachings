<!-- In this first section I have included a header that will contain the 
  main title that will be incorporated into an anchor element 
  and a navigation list for the three main pages.
  This part with the title and the nav element will be copied also in the three main pages 
  and in a fourth page which will be a simple page with a confirmation message after completing a form.

  Then, only for the first page, I will add main-image (hero-image)  along with a cover text 
  (containing a suggestive Bible verse) that will have a keyframe applied 
  to slide from the left side onto the hero image. 
  For the keyframe I was inspired from this web site: https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/keyframe-animations/-->

  <!-- In the description section I wrote the main reasons for creating the site, 
    namely the need of believers to know their own faith, 
    then I offered preliminary information about the possibility of registering for catechetical meetings 
    organized in the city of Leipzig by the parish priest together with some theologians.

    Then I added an image with an Orthodox icon with the Last Supper, 
    to show people that the Apostles were also catechized by Jesus, 
    then I added a second image that shows a group of people participating in a spiritual meeting with a priest, 
    to show people that such meetings are wanted and useful.

    Next, I have inserted a list with the important information about catechesis, briefly dotted, 
    in this list I have included three links, the first leads to the website of the parish where catechesis takes place, 
    the second leads to the page with the structure of catechesis and the last link to access form page. -->

    <div class="description-text">
      <h2>Welcome to our website!</h2>
      <p>Are you an Orthodox Christian but you feel like <strong>you don't know your faith that well?</strong>
        <p>Would you like to <strong>find out and understand more</strong> about your own faith, but you don't know
          where to look or you don't have time?</p>
        <p>If your answer is yes to at least one of these questions, then <strong>you are in the right place!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>We organize <strong>free sessions</strong> of twelve catechetical meetings for different age groups.</p>

        <h2>What is faith and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Faith is a gift from God</strong>, this great gift must be increased
          through active and conscious work to help us get to know God better and experience Him
          in a real way.</p>

        <p>The path of faith is a chance to grow in a <strong>personal relationship with God</strong></p>
        <p>Seeing that many believers, even though they are baptized, no longer know their own faith, but they have the
          desire to find more about it, we decided to help them by <strong><em>organizing orthodox
              catechesis.</em></strong>
          In these catechesis we will discuss the fundamental themes of the Orthodox Christian faith.</p>
        <p>You can find the list of the twelve themes in the menu bar at the top by accessing the structure page.
