  <!-- After the common header, in the first section on the structure page 
    I wrote about the fact that the catechetical meetings will be structured on twelve themes 
    based on a program made by an Orthodox bishop. 

    Then I inserted two images of catechetical meetings that 
    I display them alternately with a list of twelve themes of the catechesis, 
    I divided the list in two to put them in parallel with the two images, 
    at smaller sizes.
    
    I used the grid property to change the place images to 
    display them alternately with the text of the two parts of the list. 

    At the end of the section I added another image embedded in a div. 
    
    After this section, I have included a video from YouTube as an example of catechesis.
    also I added the footer that is common to all pages. -->

        <p>Our program will follow the structure of a catechetical program created by Metropolitan Kalistos Ware called
          "Path of Salvation"
          This program was designed and carried out by a group of specialists from the Institute for
          Christian-Orthodox Studies at the University of Cambridge in Great Britain.
          This "path" has twelve steps and we would be happy to make them together with you!
