__1. Purpose of the project:__
The purpose of the project is to create a website that encourages believers from a Local Orthodox Church to participate in meetings where they can learn more about their faith. This will help to form a close bond with the parish community and the priest.

__2. user stories:__
By viewing this site, users will be encouraged to get actively involved and also they could bring other people or family members to these meetings that they can enjoy together.

__3. Features:__
The site will be divided into three or four sections, it will have a blacklist that will inform the user which page they are on, then there will be some testimonies of other participants who enjoyed these meetings.
I would like to add some information regarding the time and place of these meetings as well as the registration form.
__4. future features:__
In the future, I want to add links to external sites that contain books and educational materials of the Orthodox faith, as well as the possibility of online meetings.

__5. Typography and color scheme:__
Simple typography with use of maximum two or three colors that are consistent with the main image.

__6. wireframes:__
I will use balsamiq for a preliminary structure.
